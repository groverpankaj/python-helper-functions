## Some of the helper functions which I am building to be used in my Projects/Websites


### 1. lastThursday
This function finds the date for last Thursday of a given month and year


### 2. listOfDictionariesToCSV
This function writes the list of Dictionaries to a CSV file. Each record is written in a new CSV file.
